# Instructions

 - Install dependencies, I have used `yarn`
 - Add twitter authentication details in the `TWITTER_AUTH.json` file
 - Run `yarn start`
 - A timestamped JSON file should be generated inside a `results` folder

 ## Notes

Should the program fail for some reason, you can see an example of the expected 
results in the `RESULTS_EXAMPLE.json`. This contains a JSON object in which the
key is the github repo's name. The corresponding repo will then have an array of
tweets.
